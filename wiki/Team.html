                17 undergraduate students from College of Life Science consist of the absolute main force of Team NKU_China. Sharing &rdquo;iGEMer&rdquo; as our common title, the team members work closely together from brainstorming solutions for experimental problems to discussing the future prospect of synthetic biology with great enthusiasm and creation. In the meantime, we frequently adjust the project design and experiment plans under the advice and instructions of three experienced graduate instructors and three distinguished PIs.
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                All of the team members are looking forward to presenting our project and sharing the story of the great science adventure of Team NKU_China to iGEMers all over the globe at Giant Jamboree. Do meet us at our presentation and poster stand!

I am the instructor of iGEM 2016 Team: NKU_China and I am mainly responsible for the instruction of the experiments relating to protein analysis including SDS-PAGE and western blot. It is a pleasure to share my experiences of scientific research to the junior students. My own research focuses on the relationship between structure and function of hydrophobin, which origins from fungi and has a wide range of applications in biotechnology research. In my spare time, I like playing badminton as well as other sports.

I am the instructor of iGEM 2016 Team: NKU_China and I am mainly responsible for the instruction of the experiments relating to gas chromatograph (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). My personal research focuses on the characteristics and applications of hydrophobin and I have published 6 research papers up to now. It is a great opportunity for me to provide help and instruction to junior team members as well as learn some basic principles of synthetic biology from them. The perseverance and enthusiasm of the junior students moved me a lot. I like to spend my spare time playing badminton, cards and other sports.

It&#39;s my first time to attend the iGEM competition and I believe it will be a great challenge but also a chance for me. This year, I spend most of my time on the iGEM competition. I&#39;m generally responsible for the experimental part in our team. I will do my best to complete our research and cooperate with my team member to finish the competition perfectly. Looking forward for the final match in Boston!

I&apos;ve grown from a sophomore, who was unfimiliar with synthetic biology and science research, into a senior who is devoting myself to them. I was in charge of our wiki last time and our whole project this time. I should say that iGEM has influenced me a lot in many positive ways. I hope our project will attract you this time and  my work can contribute to synbio in the future.

Besides the overall management of the team, I am also mainly responsible for the conduction of the Measurement tract and the construction of standard parts. My devotion to synthetic biology is due to the fact that even the simplest bacteria are much more delicate than the most complex machines that humans have ever built. The perfection and complexity of life system attracts me to learn and discover.

I chose the Department of Statistics when I was asked to choose my future professional direction in my junior year and got highest grade in mathematical statistics final examination in my department, which proved my solid basic skills in mathematics and a sound grounding in statistics.

I LOVE challenges and iGEM gives me the chance to experience the thrills of trying different ideas in the field of synthetic biology by means of molecular biology and microbiology. The most exciting thing to me , is when results are not what we thought to be, and the team brainstorms to come up with possible explanations and new experimental designs. Being in iGEM team is my first time to complete a project from scratch and it feels awesome. This is the third year my school takes part in iGEM and not long ago our team had our own lab. We have every reason to believe that with experience accumulated, our iGEM team will be better with our joint efforts.

                                    Being an iGEMer has opened to me a brand new world of life science&#8210;to design a life purposely, to test the possibilities. The process of parts construction was just like treasure hunting&#8210;searching for possible solutions out of weird errors and abnormal results. A long-awaited positive result was one of the sweetest moments. It&apos;s fascinating to work with a group of people and brainstorm from time to time. I&apos;ve experienced a wonderful summer.

I love doing all kinds of field work,related to observing and recording the behavior of animals and plants. Also,I enjoy lab work very much. Although  I am just an undergraduate student, I still try to grasp every opportunity to learn about science. And also,having the chance to confirm the results of science really makes me excited. I guess that&apos;s the original motive to devote myself to science.

Yet, once I entered high school, I gradually got interested in scientific research due to the great academic atmosphere of Nankai High School and now I am fond of studying mathematical problems. Moreover, it is for this very reason that I managed to join the iGEM team of Nankai University: NKU_China. This summer, I have learnt fundamental knowledge of synthetic biology from senior student team members. Also, I tried several basic molecular cloning experiments and spread the basic ideas of synthetic biology to my fellow friends in high school. I hope that I can achieve more in the field of synthetic biology in the future.
