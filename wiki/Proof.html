            <div class="p">This summer, our team is aiming to engineer bacteria for supplement and absorption of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) in the natural environment. We successfully designed two cell machines: AI-2 Supplier is the cell machine which can directly supply and enrich the AI-2 molecule while AI-2 Consumer is another cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 in the environment. We validated that AI-2 Controller works as expected by qPCR, HPLC and AI-2 Response Device. We also further demonstrated that our AI-2 controllers have the ability to manipulate biofilm formation process by 'quenching' or 'ignite' AI-2 signal in the environment.</div>

            <div class="p">There are mainly 2 steps involved in the process of AI-2 production in bacteria cells. AI-2 is produced from S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by Mtn and LuxS and accumulates extracellularly with cell density. In our project, we cloned <i>mtn</i>, <i>luxS</i> into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of proteins associated with these AI-2 production reactions in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Two AI-2 Supplier devices, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn were successfully constructed using homologous recombination method.</div>
            <div class="p">During the construction, all intermediate constructs and final plasmids were immediately verified by restriction enzyme digestion verification and/or sequencing. As you can see from Fig. 1, we obtained gel bands at expected position of AI-2 Controller devices, pLuxS and pLuxSMtn.</div>

To verify whether the device realized the function as expected, qPCR and SDS-PAGE experiments were conducted. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, two devices overexpressed <i>luxS</i> and <i>mtn</i> mRNA about 4 times than control group, pTrcHisB. Also in SDS-PAGE experiment, you can see the overexpression of LuxS and Mtn protein.</div>

                To further validate whether AI-2 Consumer Devices can actually increase AI-2 environmental AI-2 concentration, we measured the AI-2 concentration in the culture after 3 h induction of IPTG. As illustrated in Fig. 5, in the culture medium of AI-2 Supplier pLuxS and pLuxSMtn, AI-2 concentration was both increased significantly than control group. The result shows that, as expected, AI-2 concentration in the culture of AI-2 Supplier pLuxSMtn is much more than AI-2 Supplier pLuxS.

            <div class="p">There are mainly three steps involved in the processing of AI-2 from the extracellular environment. (i) uptake, primarily through the LsrACDB transporter, (ii) LsrK-mediated phosphorylation of AI-2 (to AI-2P), which blocks export back to the extracellular milieu so that accumulated AI-2P binds the regulatory protein LsrR, derepressing the Lsr transporter as well as enzymes, LsrF and LsrG, and (iii) degradation of AI-2P through the two step process from isomerase LsrG followed with cleaving and thiolation by LsrF. In our project, we cloned <i>lsrACDB</i>, <i>lsrK</i>, <i>lsrFG</i> into the plasmid pTrcHisB to enable overexpression of all proteins associated with these AI-2 processing steps in <i>E. coli</i>.

            <div class="p">To further validate whether AI-2 Consumers can actually absorb AI-2 molecules from the environment, we first characterized the uptake rate of AI-2 by adding a fixed amount of exogenous AI-2 and monitored the extracellular concentration by HPLC. Each strain was grown to mid-logarithmic phase (OD~0.4) with the subsequent addition of 40 &mu;M AI-2 and 1 mM IPTG and optical density was recorded throughout.</div>
            <div class="p">We found that all AI-2 Consumers, pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG, pLsrACDBK and pLsrACDBFGK successfully manipulated AI-2 signal in the environment, as expected. As shown in Fig. 14, after the IPTG induction, AI-2 concentration in the environment was significantly reduced in three hours, which means that constructed AI-2 Consumers can 'quench' AI-2 signal in the environment. What's more, statistical analysis shows that AI-2 Consumer pLsrACDBFGK has the most significant absorption ability in manipulating extracellular AI-2 concentration, while there is no significant difference on absorption ability among Device pLsrACDB, pLsrACDBFG and pLsrACDBK.</div>
